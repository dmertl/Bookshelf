<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">The words ‘science’ and ‘scientist’ are surprisingly modern inventions. In fact, the word ‘scientist’ was coined by the Victorian polymath William Whewell, who used it in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> in March 1834. The Americans took to the word almost immediately, and by the end of the century it was also popular in Britain. The word is based on the Latin <i>scientia,</i> which means ‘knowledge’, and it supplanted other terms such as ‘natural philosopher’.</p>
<p class="indent">This book is a history of the Big Bang model, but at the same time it attempts to provide an insight into what science is and how it works. The Big Bang model is a good example of how a scientific idea is created, tested, verified and accepted. Nevertheless, science is such a broad activity that this book’s description of it is incomplete. So, in an attempt to fill in some of the gaps, here is a selection of quotations about science.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">Science is organized knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>HERBERT SPENCER</small> (1820-1903), English philosopher<br/><br/></p>

<p class="noindent">[Science is] an imaginative adventure of the mind seeking truth in a world of mystery.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>CYRIL HERMAN</small> HINSHELWOOD (1897-1967), English chemist<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">[Science is] a great game. It is inspiring and refreshing. The playing field is the universe itself.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>ISIDOR ISAAC RABI</small> (1898-1988), American physicist<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">Man masters nature not by force but by understanding. This is why science has succeeded where magic failed: because it has looked for no spell to cast over nature.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>JACOB BRONOWSKI</small> (1908-74), British scientist and author<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">That is the essence of science: ask an impertinent question, and you are on the way to a pertinent answer.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>JACOB BRONOWSKI</small> (1908-74), British scientist and author<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">It is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast. It keeps him young.</p>

<p class="noindent">Truth in science can best be defined as the working hypothesis best suited to open the way to the next better one.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>KONRAD LORENZ</small> (1903-89), Austrian zoologist<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">In essence, science is a perpetual search for an intelligent and integrated comprehension of the world we live in.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>CORNELIUS VAN NEIL</small> (1897-1985), American microbiologist<br/><br/></p>

<p class="noindent"><small>CLAUDE LEVI-STRAUSS</small> (1908-), French anthropologist</p>
<p class="noindent">Science can only ascertain what <i>is</i>, but not what <i>should be</i>, and outside of its domain value judgements of all kinds remain necessary. <small>ALBERT EINSTEIN</small> (1879-1955), German-born physicist <a id="page497"/>Science is the disinterested search for the objective truth about the material world.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>RICHARD DAWKINS</small> (1941- ), English biologist<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">Science is nothing but trained and organised common sense differing from the latter only as a veteran may differ from a raw recruit; and its methods differ from those of common sense only as far as the guardsman’s cut and thrust differ from the manner in which a savage wields his club.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY</small> (1825-95), English biologist<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Four stages of acceptance:</p>
<p class="noindent">i) this is worthless nonsense,</p>
<p class="noindent">ii) this is an interesting, but perverse, point of view,</p>
<p class="noindent">iii) this is true, but quite unimportant,</p>
<p class="noindent">iv) I always said so.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><small>J.B.S. HALDANE</small> (1892-1964), English geneticist<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.</p>
<p class="noindent"><small>RICHARD FEYNMAN</small> (1918-88), American physicist<br/><br/></p>
