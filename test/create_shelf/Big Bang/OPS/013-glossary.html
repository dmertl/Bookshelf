<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Terms in italics have their own entry in the glossary.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="hang"><b>absorption</b> The process by which <i>atoms</i> absorb light at specific <i>wavelengths,</i> allowing their presence to be detected by <i>spectroscopy</i> by identifying the ‘missing’ wavelengths.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>alpha particle A</b> subatomic particle ejected during certain kinds of <i>radioactive decay.</i> The particle, consisting of two <i>protons</i> and two <i>neutrons,</i> is identical to the <i>nucleus</i> of a <i>helium atom.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>anthropic principle</b> The principle that states that, since humans are known to exist, the laws of physics must be such that life can exist. In its extreme form, the anthropic principle states that the universe has been designed to allow life.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>arcminute</b> A unit used in the measurement of very small angles, equal to <sup class="frac">1</sup>/<sub class="frac">60</sub> of 1°.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>arcsecond</b> A unit used in the measurement of very small angles, equal to <sup class="frac">1</sup>/<sub class="frac">60</sub> of an <i>arcminute</i> or <sup class="frac">1</sup>/<sub class="frac">3,600</sub> of 1°.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>atom</b> The smallest component of an <i>element,</i> comprising a positively charged <i>nucleus</i> surrounded by negatively charged <i>electrons.</i> The number of positively charged <i>protons</i> in the nucleus uniquely determines which chemical element the atom belongs to. For example, every atom containing a single proton is an atom of <i>hydrogen,</i> while every atom containing 79 protons is an atom of gold.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>Big Bang model</b> The currently accepted <i>model</i> of the universe, according to which time and space emerged from a hot, dense, compact region between 10 and 20 billion years ago.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>Cepheid variable star A</b> type of <i>star</i> whose brightness varies over a precise, regular period, usually between 1 and 100 days. The period of variation is directly linked to the star’s average luminosity, which can <a id="page500"/>therefore be calculated. By comparing the star’s luminosity to the apparent brightness as seen from the Earth, its distance can be accurately determined. These stars therefore play an important role in determining the cosmic distance scale.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>CMB radiation</b> See <i>cosmic microwave background radiation.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer)</b> A satellite launched in 1989 to make accurate measurements of the <i>cosmic microwave background</i> (CMB) <i>radiation.</i> Its DMR detector provided the first evidence for variations in the CMB radiation, indicative of regions in the early universe that led to <i>galaxy</i> formation.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>Copernican model</b> The Sun-centred <i>model</i> of the universe, proposed by Nicholas Copernicus in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation</b> A pervasive ‘sea’ of <i>microwave radiation</i> emanating almost uniformly from every direction in the universe, which dates back to the moment of <i>recombination.</i> This radiation is the ‘echo’ of the <i>Big Bang,</i> predicted by Gamow, Alpher and Herman in 1948, and detected by Penzias and Wilson in 1965. Originating in the heat of the Big Bang, it has since been stretched from <i>infrared</i> to microwave <i>wavelengths</i> by the expansion of the universe. The <i>COBE</i> satellite measured variations in the CMB radiation.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>cosmological constant</b> An extra parameter incorporated by Einstein into the equations of his <i>general theory of relativity</i> when it became clear that his equations implied either a growing or a shrinking universe. By effectively introducing anti-gravity, the equations then permitted a static universe.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>cosmological principle</b> The principle that no location in the universe is preferred over any other, and that the overall features of the universe appear to be the same in all directions <i>(isotropic)</i> and no matter where the observer is located <i>(homogeneous).</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>cosmology</b> The study of the origin and evolution of the universe.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>creation field (C-field)</b> A theoretical concept introduced as part of the <i>Steady State model.</i> The C-field maintained the overall density of the universe by creating matter to fill the gaps resulting from the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>cross-section</b> A quantity used by particle physicists to assess the likelihood of two particles colliding.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>dark energy</b> A postulated form of energy that could account for recent observations which imply that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Although calculations suggest that it may make a dominant contribution <a id="page501"/>to the mass-energy in the universe, there is no agreement on its nature.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>dark matter</b> A postulated form of matter, believed to make up a significant fraction of the matter in the universe. It makes its presence felt via its <i>gravity,</i> but emits little or no <i>visible light.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>deferent</b> The large circle used to describe the motion of a celestial body around the Earth in the <i>Ptolemaic model.</i> When combined with a smaller <i>epicycle,</i> the observed planetary motions could be approximately replicated.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>deuterium</b> An <i>isotope</i> of <i>hydrogen</i> containing one <i>proton</i> and one <i>neutron</i> in the <i>nucleus.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>Doppler</b> effect The change in <i>wavelength</i> of sound or <i>electromagnetic waves</i> emitted by a moving source. The same effect occurs if it is the observer (not the source) that is moving. Waves are compressed ahead of the source and stretched behind it, producing, for example, the familiar change in the pitch of a siren from high to low as an ambulance passes by at speed. A similar effect causes the <i>redshift</i> in the spectrum of a receding <i>galaxy.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>electromagnetic radiation</b> A travelling form of energy, including <i>visible light, radio waves</i> and X-rays. Electromagnetic radiation moves through space as <i>electromagnetic waves</i> at the <i>speed of light.</i> The <i>wavelength</i> of the radiation determines its qualities.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>electromagnetic spectrum</b> The complete range of <i>wavelengths</i> of <i>electromagnetic radiation,</i> from short-wavelength (high-energy) gamma rays and X-rays, through <i>ultraviolet, visible light</i> and <i>infrared,</i> to long-wavelength (low-energy) <i>radio waves.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>electromagnetic waves</b> A harmonised vibration of electric and magnetic fields, each sustaining the other and propagating together through space as <i>electromagnetic radiation.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>electron</b> A subatomic particle with negative charge. Electrons can exist independently or in orbit around the positively charged <i>nucleus</i> of an <i>atom.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>element</b> One of the basic materials of the universe, as listed in the periodic table. The smallest quantity of an element is an <i>atom,</i> and the number <i>of protons</i> in the atom determines the type of element.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>emission</b> The process by which <i>atoms</i> are excited (for example by heating) and emit light at specific <i>wavelengths,</i> allowing their presence to be detected by <i>spectroscopy.</i></p>
<p class="hang">epicycle The small circle used in the Earth-centred <i>Ptolemaic model</i> of the <a id="page502"/>universe, in addition to the <i>deferent,</i> to account for the looping <i>retrograde motions</i> of some planets as they moved in their supposed orbits around the Earth.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>ether</b> The all-pervading substance through which light was once believed to propagate. Its existence was disproved by the <i>Michelson-Morley experiment.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>exponential notation</b> A convenient method of abbreviating very large or very small numbers. For example 1,200 can be written as 1.2×10<sup>3</sup> because it equals 1.2×(10×10×10), and 0.0005 can be written as 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> because it equals 5 ÷ (10×10×10×10).</p>
<p class="hang"><b>fission</b> The process by which a large atomic <i>nucleus</i> is broken apart to produce two smaller nuclei, generally releasing energy as a result. <i>Radioactive decay</i> is a fission process that occurs spontaneously.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>fusion</b> The process by which two small atomic <i>nuclei</i> join together to make a single larger nucleus, generally releasing energy as a result. For example, <i>hydrogen</i> nuclei can fuse via a multi-step process to form <i>helium.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>galaxy A</b> collection of <i>stars,</i> gas and dust held together by <i>gravity,</i> usually separated from neighbouring galaxies, and often spiral or elliptical in shape. Galaxies range in size from around a million stars to several billion.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>general theory of relativity</b> Einstein’s theory of <i>gravity,</i> which underpins the science of <i>cosmology.</i> General relativity describes gravity as a curvature in four-dimensional <i>spacetime.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>gravity</b> An attractive force experienced between any pair of massive bodies. Gravity was first described by Newton, but Einstein produced a more accurate description in his <i>general theory of relativity</i> that depended on the curvature of <i>spacetime.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>helium</b> The second most common and second-lightest <i>element</i> in the universe, after <i>hydrogen.</i> Its <i>nucleus</i> contains two <i>protons</i> and (usually) two <i>neutrons.</i> The pressures and temperatures inside <i>stars</i> can force helium to undergo nuclear <i>fusion</i> to form heavier nuclei.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>homogeneous</b> Having similar properties at all locations.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>Hubble constant (<i>H</i><sub>0</sub>)</b> A measurable parameter of the universe, describing its rate of expansion. It is believed to have a value of 50-100 km/s/Mpc, meaning that a <i>galaxy</i> 1 megaparsec away will be receding at between 50 and 100 km/s. The Hubble constant emerges from the definition of <i>Hubble’s law.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>Hubble’s law</b> The empirically determined law stating that the recessional velocity of a <i>galaxy</i> is proportional to its distance: <i>v = H<sub>0</sub>×d.</i> The constant of proportionality in the equation (<i>H</i><sub>0</sub>) is the <i>Hubble constant.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><a id="page503"/><b>hydrogen</b> The simplest and most abundant <i>element</i> in the universe, containing one <i>proton</i> in its <i>nucleus,</i> orbited by one <i>electron.</i> See also <i>deuterium.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>inflation</b> The phase of extremely rapid expansion during the first 10<sup>-35</sup> seconds of the universe. Although inflation is hypothetical, it would explain several features of the universe.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>infrared</b> The portion of the <i>electromagnetic spectrum</i> with slightly longer <i>wavelengths</i> than <i>visible light.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>isotope</b> A variant of a single <i>element,</i> distinguished by having a different number of <i>neutrons</i> in its <i>nucleus.</i> For example, <i>hydrogen</i> has three isotopes, possessing zero, one and two neutrons respectively, but all contain just one <i>proton.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>isotropic</b> Similar in all directions.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>light wave</b> See <i>electromagnetic wave.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>light year</b> The distance travelled by light in one calendar year, approximately 9,460,000,000,000 km.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>Michelson-Morley experiment</b> An experiment conducted in the late nineteenth century to detect the Earth’s motion through the <i>ether</i> by measuring the <i>speed of light</i> both in the direction of and perpendicular to the Earth’s direction of travel. The experiment disproved the existence of the ether.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>microwave radiation</b> A portion of the <i>electromagnetic spectrum</i> with <i>wavelengths</i> of a few millimetres or centimetres. It is usually regarded as a subdivision of <i>radio waves.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>Milky Way</b> A name given to the <i>galaxy</i> in which our Solar System resides. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy containing around 200 billion <i>stars,</i> and the Sun is located in one of its spiral arms.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>model</b> A self-consistent set of rules and parameters intended to describe mathematically some aspect of the real world.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>multiverse</b> An alternative <i>model</i> to the single universe, in which many different universes co-exist, each accommodating a different set of physical laws, and each isolated from all the others.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>nebula</b> A cloud of gas and, often, dust in the <i>Milky Way</i> galaxy seen as an indistinct patch of light in the night sky, in contrast to the point-like <i>stars.</i> In the twentieth century, following the resolution of the Great Debate, many objects labelled as nebulae before 1900 were recognised to be separate <i>galaxies.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>neutron</b> A particle found inside atomic <i>nuclei.</i> A neutron has almost the same mass as a <i>proton,</i> but carries no electric charge.</p>
<p class="hang"><a id="page504"/><b>nova</b> A <i>star</i> that rapidly becomes, typically, 50,000 times brighter in a few days, and then returns to its former brightness over the course of a few months. A nova is fuelled by material flowing from a nearby companion star.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>nuclear physics</b> The study of atomic <i>nuclei,</i> their interactions and their structure.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>nucleon</b> A generic term for <i>protons</i> and <i>neutrons,</i> the two particles found in atomic <i>nuclei.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>nucleosynthesis</b> The formation of the <i>elements</i> via nuclear <i>fusion,</i> particularly in <i>stars</i> and in <i>supernova</i> explosions. The nucleosynthesis of the lightest atomic <i>nuclei</i> took place in the moments after the <i>Big Bang.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>nucleus</b> The compact structure at the centre of an <i>atom,</i> containing <i>protons</i> and <i>neutrons,</i> and accounting for at least 99.95% of the mass of any atom.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>parallax</b> The apparent shift in location of an object when an observer changes position. <i>Stellar parallax</i> is used in astronomy to measure the distance to the closest <i>stars.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>parsec</b> A unit of distance used in astronomy, equal to about 3.26 <i>light years.</i> Short for ‘parallax second’, it is the distance at which an object would show a <i>stellar parallax</i> of one <i>arcsecond.</i> A distance of 1 million parsecs is known as 1 megaparsec (Mpc).</p>
<p class="hang"><b>perfect cosmological principle</b> An extension of the <i>cosmological principle</i> which states that the universe is not only <i>homogeneous</i> and <i>isotropic,</i> but also unchanging with time. This principle is the basis of the <i>Steady State model.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>plasma</b> A high-temperature state of matter in which atomic <i>nuclei</i> become separated from their <i>electrons.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>primeval atom theory</b> Georges Lemaître’s early version of the <i>Big Bang model</i> in which all the <i>atoms</i> in the universe were originally contained in one compact ‘primeval atom’. The explosion of the primeval atom initiated the universe.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>proper motion</b> The apparent motion of a <i>star</i> across the sky, caused by its actual motion with respect to the Sun. The effect is so slight that it was not detected until 1718.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>proton</b> A positively charged subatomic particle found in the <i>nucleus</i> of an <i>atom.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><a id="page505"/><b>Ptolemaic model</b> The flawed Earth-centred model of the universe, in which all other cosmic bodies followed orbits around the Earth. These orbits were constructed from perfect circles called <i>deferents</i> and <i>epicycles.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>quasar</b> An intensely bright object, appearing like a <i>star</i> (‘quasi-stellar’), but now known to be a highly luminous young <i>galaxy</i> that existed early in the universe. Quasars are observable today only in the most distant reaches of the universe, as the light reaching us from the far universe started its journey when the universe was much younger.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>Quasi-Steady State model</b> A modified version of the <i>Steady State model</i> which attempts to make up for some of the inconsistencies in the original model.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>radial velocity</b> The velocity of a <i>star</i> or <i>galaxy</i> towards or away from the Earth. This component of a star’s motion can be determined from the <i>Doppler effect</i> on light or other <i>electromagnetic waves</i> emitted by the star or galaxy.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>radioactive decay</b> The process by which an atomic <i>nucleus</i> spontaneously transforms itself and releases energy. Typically it will change into a lighter, more stable nucleus.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>radioactivity</b> The tendency of certain <i>atoms</i> (e.g. uranium) to undergo <i>radioactive decay.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>radio astronomy</b> The study of <i>radio waves</i> emitted by astronomical objects, using <i>radio telescopes</i> rather than optical telescopes.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>radio galaxy</b> A type of <i>galaxy</i> notable for its strong emission of <i>radio waves.</i> The radio emission from such a galaxy is about a million times as strong as that from a normal galaxy such as the <i>Milky Way.</i> Only about one in a million galaxies falls into this category.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>radio telescope</b> An instrument designed to detect <i>radio waves</i> from celestial radio sources. Radio telescopes are highly sensitive radio receivers and have the form of an antenna or a dish.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>radio waves</b> <i>Electromagnetic radiation</i> with <i>wavelengths</i> longer than a few millimetres, including microwaves. The study of radio waves emitted by celestial objects is called <i>radio astronomy.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>recombination</b> The moment when the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow <i>electrons</i> to bind to <i>nuclei,</i> transforming matter from <i>plasma</i> to <i>atoms</i> with no overall electric charge. This occurred when the universe was roughly 300,000 years old and at a temperature of about 3,000°C. From that moment, <i>electromagnetic radiation</i> was able to travel through the universe almost unhindered; today we detect it as the <i>cosmic microwave background radiation.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><a id="page506"/><b>redshift</b> An increase in the <i>wavelength</i> of emitted light caused by the emitter’s recessional velocity and the resulting <i>Doppler effect.</i> In cosmology this term is usually associated with the stretching of <i>light waves</i> from a distant <i>galaxy</i> as the universe expands. The galaxy is not receding through space, but the expansion of space itself is causing the redshift.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>relativity</b> See <i>general theory of relativity</i> and <i>special theory of relativity.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>retrograde motion</b> The temporary change in the apparent direction of motion of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. It is a consequence of observing these planets from the Earth, which has a higher orbital speed around the Sun.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>RR</b> Lyrae star A type of variable <i>star</i> less luminous than a <i>Cepheid variable,</i> and with a period between 9 and 17 hours. The inability to detect any RR Lyrae stars in the Andromeda Galaxy in the 1940s was an important clue that the <i>galaxy</i> was more distant than previously thought.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>similar triangles</b> Any pair of triangles of the same shape but different sizes. The two triangles have all three angles in common, and corresponding edges scale in the same proportion.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>Solvay Conferences</b> A series of prestigious invitation-only conferences held every few years to discuss particular problems at the forefront of physics.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>spacetime</b> The unified construct in which the three dimensions of space combine with the fourth dimension of time to produce the underlying framework of our universe. The concept of spacetime is an integral part of Einstein’s <i>special</i> and <i>general theories of relativity.</i> The curvature of spacetime leads to the force that we interpret as <i>gravity.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>special theory of relativity</b> Einstein’s theory based on the premise that the <i>speed of light</i> is the same for all observers regardless of their own motion. Its most famous consequence is the equivalence of energy and matter, expressed by the equation <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</i> It also implies that the perception of time and space depends on the observer. The theory is a ‘special’ case because it does not deal with objects which are accelerating or experiencing <i>gravity,</i> for which Einstein later developed the <i>general theory of relativity.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>spectroscope</b> An instrument that separates <i>light waves</i> into their component <i>wavelengths</i> for analysis. It can be used to identify the <i>atoms</i> that emitted the light or to measure the amount of <i>redshift.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>spectroscopy</b> The study of light by splitting it into its component <i>wavelengths</i> to learn about the nature of its source.</p>
<p class="hang"><a id="page507"/><b>speed of light</b> (c) A constant equal to exactly 299,792,458 m/s. According to the <i>special theory of relativity,</i> the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their own motion.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>star</b> A ball of predominantly <i>hydrogen,</i> pulled together under the effect of its own <i>gravity,</i> with sufficient mass for the temperatures and pressures inside to initiate nuclear <i>fusion.</i> Stars tend to occur in formations called <i>galaxies.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>Steady State model</b> A largely discredited <i>model</i> of the universe in which the universe expands and new matter is created in the growing gaps between <i>galaxies.</i> The universe would thus maintain a similar density at all times, and would last for eternity.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>stellar parallax</b> The apparent shift in position of a nearby <i>star</i> against the background of distant stars, caused by the observer’s shift in position as the Earth orbits the Sun.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>supernova</b> The catastrophic explosion of a <i>star</i> that has exhausted its <i>hydrogen</i> fuel source. Heavier elements vital for life are generated in the events leading up to and during a supernova.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>thought experiment</b> An experiment conducted by thinking through a logical chain of events. This is useful when the conditions required to carry out a real experiment are prohibitive.</p>
<p class="hang"><b>ultraviolet (UV)</b> <i>Electromagnetic radiation</i> with a slightly shorter <i>wavelength</i> than that of <i>visible light.</i></p>
<p class="hang"><b>visible light</b> A region of the <i>electromagnetic spectrum</i> containing the <i>electromagnetic radiation</i> which humans can see. The <i>wavelengths</i> range from 0.0004mm (violet) to 0.0007 mm (red).</p>
<p class="hang"><b>wavelength</b> The distance between two successive peaks (or troughs) of a wave. The wavelength of <i>electromagnetic radiation</i> determines which part of the <i>electromagnetic spectrum</i> it belongs to and its overall properties.</p>
