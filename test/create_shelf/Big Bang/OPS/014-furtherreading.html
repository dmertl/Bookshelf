<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">This book has tried to explain a big subject in a relatively small amount of space. For readers who would like to explore some of the topics in more detail, the following list of books (and a few articles) might be of interest. They range from popular science to more technical texts, and the books are arranged under the chapter heading that is most appropriate to their contents. Many of them were used in the research and writing of <i>Big Bang,</i> but others go beyond the scope of this book, particularly those that relate to material covered in the Epilogue.</p>
