<h1 class="left"><a id="page517"/><a href="005-toc.html#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h1>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Over the last couple of years I have relied on numerous people to help me write this book. I am enormously grateful to Ralph Alpher, Allan Sandage, Arno Penzias and the late Thomas Gold, who all took time to tell me about their contributions to the development of cosmology. Their patience and good nature were much appreciated. Helge Kragh at the University of Aarhus and Ian Morrison at Jodrell Bank were also very supportive, as were Nancy Wilson and Don Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory. I was also able to visit Bell Laboratories, and I would like to thank all the people who took me around the various facilities there, in particular Saswato Das.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks also go to Arthur Miller at University College (London), who introduced me to the work of Fritz Houtermans, and to Nigel Henbest, who pointed me towards the important contributions of Stanley Hey. I was able to interview Arno Penzias and heard the original Third Programme recordings of Fred Hoyle while I was working on the BBC radio programmes ‘The Serendipity of Science’ and ‘Material World’; I am grateful to the producers of those programmes, Amanda Hargreaves, Monise Durrani and Andrew Luckbaker, who unwittingly helped to re-ignite my interest in cosmology.</p>
<p class="indent">Various people gave me valuable feedback on the manuscript as it developed, including Martin Rees and David Bodanis, who managed to find time to help me even though they were ridiculously busy on their own projects. Emma King, Alex Seeley, Amarendra Swarup and Mina Varsani all helped me during the various stages of this project, and I am grateful for all their contributions. In particular, my assistant Debbie Pearson helped me to research several parts of this book, arranging for me to visit the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, and tracking down many of the photographs in the book.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page518"/>Various archives and libraries are mentioned in the picture credits section, but the following people and institutions went beyond the call of duty in their efforts to help: Peter D. Hingley (Royal Astronomical Society), Heather Lindsay (Emilio Segré Visual Archives), Dan Lewis (The Huntington Library), John Grula (Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington), Jonathan Harrison (St John’s College Library), Iosif Khriplovich (University of Novosibirsk), Cheryl Dandridge (Lick Observatory Archives), Lewis Wyman (Library of Congress), Liliane Moens (Lemaître Archives, Catholic University, Louvain), and Mark Hurn, Sarah Bridle and Jochen Weller (Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge).</p>
<p class="indent">I should like to thank Iolo ap Gwynn at University of Wales Bio-Imaging Laboratory, who specially created the magnified images of paper shown in Figure 99, and Alison Doane at Harvard College Observatory, who changed her plans at short notice to show me the photographic stacks that house the work of Henrietta Leavitt and her colleagues. I have also been able to include several remarkable photographs of Fred Hoyle in this book, and I am enormously grateful to Barbara Hoyle and the Master and Fellows of St John’s College for permission to use these images from the Hoyle Collection at St John’s College, Cambridge.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous friends and colleagues have kept me cheerful by adding a mix of interesting and fun diversions to my daily diet of reading, learning and writing about cosmology (which is already interesting and fun in itself). Hugh Mason, Ravi Kapur, Sharon Herkes and Valerie Burke-Ward have all worked with me on developing UAS, a project that encourages undergraduates to spend time in schools. Being involved in this project has kept me continually aware of the various issues relating to science education. Claire Ellis and Claire Greer have run code-breaking workshops in schools on my behalf, demonstrating the relevance of mathematics to young people. It is their hard work and enthusiasm that have taken the Enigma Project to tens of thousands of students. And I should also like to thank Nick Mee, who turned the idea of <i>The Code Book</i> on CD-ROM into a reality. He has also allowed me to have regular glimpses of the night sky through his telescope, which is always a great experience.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the last couple of years I have been involved with the National Museum of Science and Industry, the Science Media Centre and the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), which have all stretched my brain in new ways. Thanks go to everybody <a id="page519"/>at all three institutions for putting up with my ideas and interference. Suzanne Stevenson is deserving of special thanks because she and her colleagues help to keep me on track, providing me with constant advice, support and encouragement. Without her rock-solid presence, I would not be able to develop new ideas and projects.</p>
<p class="indent">Raj and Francesca Persaud have done a terrific job of keeping me sane and focused, while Roger Highfield, Holly, Rory, Asha and Sachin have given me a unique insight into the parks and museums of Greenwich, which has been a refreshing highlight of my week. Richard Wiseman has played a valuable role in keeping my obsessions in check, and he also introduced me to the wonders of bubble magic, for which I am truly grateful. Shyama Perera went out of her way to drag me away from my desk, which was always much needed and appreciated. And I am also grateful to my two nieces, Anna and Rachael, who continue to act as my fashion police and who have been eradicating my cardigan fixation. I am also glad that Rachael provided me with an excuse to travel to southern India last year, where she was teaching at Teddy School in Tirumangalam and making the most of her gap year. I know that the pupils, teachers and staff were grateful for her enthusiasm and cool head, and I know that she learned a lot from the devoted staff at this inspirational institution, which is helping to transform the local community. I am also grateful to Fiona Burtt, whose friendly words of advice have been much appreciated over the last couple of years.</p>
<p class="indent">While writing <i>Big Bang</i> I have received considerable support in turning my scribblings into a real book. Raymond Turvey drew all the illustrations, and Terence Caven was responsible for designing the overall look and layout of the book. John Woodruff, who was involved in <i>The Code Book,</i> played a central role in transforming a rough and ready draft into a polished manuscript. Indeed, he has played a quiet, behind-the-scenes role in editing and correcting dozens of science books over the last twenty years. He is one of the unsung heroes of science publishing.</p>
<p class="indent">Christopher Potter has been a guiding influence ever since I started writing, and I am glad that he has been able to be involved in the development of <i>Big Bang.</i> Mitzi Angel has been my new editor and has been absolutely brilliant, acting as a perfect sounding board and source of friendly advice. I should also like to thank my overseas editors from Italy to Japan, from France to Brazil, from Sweden to Israel and from Germany to Greece, who continue to support my writing across the globe. In turn, <a id="page520"/>they work with some of the world’s best translators, who take on the challenge of translating a book that contains both narrative prose and scientific explanation. There are very few translators capable of working in such a specialised area of publishing, and I am grateful to those who make my books accessible beyond the English-speaking world.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, everybody at Conville &amp; Walsh Literary Agency has been professional and charming during the writing of this book, even though I am sure that I am one of their more awkward authors. In particular, Patrick Walsh, who has been my literary agent ever since I started writing, almost a decade ago, works tirelessly on my behalf. He provides me with frank comments on my work and is always there during times of crisis, and I cannot imagine there are many literary agents who would accompany their authors to Zambia to witness a solar eclipse. In short, Patrick has been the best friend that any author could wish for.<br/><br/></p>
