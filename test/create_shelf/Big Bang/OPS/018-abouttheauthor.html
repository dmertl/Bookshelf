<h2 class="left">From Somerset to Space</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;"><i>Simon Singh talks to Louise Tucker</i><br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Tell me about your own universe: where were you born and where did you grow up?</i> I grew up and went to school in Somerset – I belong to the West Country Singh clan. For some strange reason my grandfather and others from our village, Thakarki in the Punjab, chose to settle in Somerset and Devon when they arrived in England in the 1930s. Virtually all of my family’s close relatives are now settled in Britain, America or Canada, but we still go back to India every couple of years.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>What did you want to be when you grew up?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">I have a strong recollection of being ten years old and my sister asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I replied that I would become ‘a nuclear physicist’. In fact my PhD was in particle physics, which is more like sub-nuclear physics, but it was a fairly accurate prediction.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>What is your first memory of science?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">I remember my father once showed me something called a dozel when I was maybe seven or eight. It was a stick with a propeller on the end, which spun freely. When a rod was scraped along the stick’s ridged back nothing would happen…until my father said the magic word ‘dozel’, whereupon the propeller would spin. Repetition of the word would cause it to spin the other way, and a third mention of dozel would bring it to a halt. It turns out that it is the way you hold your hand that determines whether or not it spins and its direction, but at the time I was baffled. I have only ever seen a dozel on one other occasion, which was in America and it was called a Hooey stick. It now sits on my mantelpiece.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Your dedication credits many science TV presenters, such as Magnus Pyke and James Burke, for inspiring your interest in science. In an era in which television is sometimes blamed for not being educational enough, do you think it still has a role in inspiring children?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Absolutely – I was inspired by TV boffins and I would hope that TV can help inspire the next generation of scientists. Children’s TV seems to be doing a great job, but I am not sure that the major channels are giving science enough prominence in prime time or nurturing new on-screen talent. Unless it’s dinosaurs or medicine, TV execs seem to think science is not a mainstream subject.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>You are very involved in various educational projects promoting science. What do you think of current science education?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">I am worried that science and mathematics education is in a major crisis, and it comes down to one thing – a lack of qualified schoolteachers. Teachers inspire students, so a shortage means fewer students study science at university, so fewer become teachers, and then you enter a downward spiral. My job is easy compared to a schoolteacher’s because I can choose my subjects and I am writing for and broadcasting to a willing audience, whereas teachers have to make even the dull parts of the curriculum interesting to students who might require convincing that science is important. I have a huge respect for those people who do go into teaching. It requires both knowledge and the ability to communicate, and if you have that combination of talents then there are many other job opportunities, particularly in this age of technology. I wish I could offer some solutions, but I am not sure how we turn the tide and encourage more people to go into the classroom.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>You’ve written books, produced and directed TV and radio programmes and lectured all over the world. Of what are you most proud?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The BBC <i>Horizon</i> documentary that I made in 1996 with John Lynch still means a great deal to me. It proved that mathematics could be exciting and passionate, and because of the power of TV it has been seen by tens of millions of people around the world. It showed older mathphobes that numbers could be thrilling and it showed younger people that mathematics was worth studying. I still meet people who say that it encouraged them to pursue mathematics at university, and that is incredibly satisfying for me.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>As a writer who prides himself on communicating difficult ideas, who are the writers that you admire most and who have influenced you?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">I have a particular respect for scientists who take the time to write for the general reader.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no reason why Martin Rees, Steve Jones or Marcus du Sautoy should take a break from doing top-notch research, and instead write books. Presumably they realise that their books have a huge impact on the public and budding scientists.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Is there any book that you wish you had written?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">I admire clever ideas for books. So although I could not have written <i>Dr Tatiana’s Sex Advice to All Creation</i> by Olivia Judson, I wish I had thought of writing a book about animal behaviour in terms of letters from various species to a zoological agony aunt. Similarly, I wish I had thought of writing about the development of the telegraph, which puts the current information revolution into context. This is the subject of <i>The Victorian Internet</i> by Tom Standage.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>What do you read when you’re writing?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Books directly relevant to whatever I am writing about and nothing else. I write about subjects that are generally new to me, so I have to completely immerse myself in these subjects – mathematics, cryptography or cosmology – in order to get up to speed.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>What motivates you to write?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">There are two reasons. First, I love learning about science and mathematics, so it is great fun and a real privilege to spend a couple of years reading about a particular subject and meeting the leading thinkers. Second, I want to get other people excited about science and mathematics. I find them amazing and fascinating and either I have to grab people on the street and tell them about what I have just learned or I write books about it, and the latter is less likely to get me into trouble.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>In an interview a few years ago you mentioned that</i> Big Bang <i>would be your last book. Is that still the case?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Bearing in mind the answer to my last question, this is a tough one to answer, but I do indeed think that this is likely to be my last major book. I have always flitted between careers, and I have enjoyed not quite knowing where I will go next. I spent a few years doing my PhD, a few years directing TV, a few years broadcasting and a few years writing, so now it seems like time for a change. The biggest problem with writing a book is that it completely takes over my life, and there are always lots of other things that I would like to do which get ignored. Even if I stopped writing for a decade, I could begin to explore some of these other interests. And many of these interests still relate to communicating science and mathematics, so to a large extent my answer to the previous question still holds true.</p>

<h2 class="left">LIFE at a Glance</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Simon Singh was born in Somerset in 1964. He studied physics at Imperial College, London, and then completed his PhD in particle physics at Cambridge University and CERN, Geneva. Having failed to discover the top quark, he abandoned any pretence at being a serious scientist and joined the BBC in 1991, working on programmes such as <i>Tomorrow’s World</i> and <i>Horizon.</i> His documentary about Fermat’s Last Theorem won a BAFTA, and this notorious mathematics problem also became the subject of his first book.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">Simon’s second book, <i>The Code Book,</i> examined the history of cryptography from Ancient Greece to the internet. He then presented a TV series on Channel 4 entitled <i>The Science of Secrecy</i> based on the book. He has also hosted <i>Mind Games</i> on BBC4 and <i>Five Numbers</i> on Radio 4. In 2002 he worked alongside Richard Wiseman on a live show entitled <i>Theatre of Science,</i> which was performed at the Soho Theatre in London and at the Edinburgh Fringe.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">Simon lives in London. He loves rattlebacks, non-transitive dice, magic tricks, gambling, electrocuting gherkins, trash TV and the Violent Femmes. His website is at <b>www.simonsingh.net</b></p>
