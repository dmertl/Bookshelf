<h1 class="left"><a href="005-toc.html#aboutthebook">About the book</a></h1>
<h2 class="left">A Critical Eye</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">It is difficult to summarise the breadth of reviewers’ responses to <i>Big Bang.</i> Descriptions ranged from ‘epic’ and’ wonderful’ to ‘beautiful’ and ‘entertaining’. Many reviews emphasised the lucidity of Singh’s writing: <b>Nature</b> said that ‘this very well-written book conveys the ideas underpinning cosmological theory with great clarity’, and the <b>Economist</b> called it ‘a model of clarity’.</p>
<p class="noindent">Singh’s ability to tell a complex story engagingly was also widely praised: ‘Singh is a very gifted storyteller who never misses the chance to make his subject clearer or more entertaining,’ wrote Scarlett Thomas in the <b>Independent on Sunday;</b> the <b>Guardian</b> commented that ‘Singh tells his tale well, with chatty anecdotes leavening the astrophysics’; and the <b>Daily Telegraph</b> described the book as ‘an epic tale brilliantly told, packed with courage and tragedy, heroes and martyrs’.</p>
<p class="indent">But, most of all, the book won plaudits for its tackling of a subject that still strikes fear into many otherwise very intelligent adults: mathematics.‘Even the most mathematically hobbled of us,’ said the <b>Sunday Telegraph,</b> could be enabled to understand ‘the history of man’s intellectual engagement with the dark spaces around him’ by reading <i>Big Bang.</i> And in the <b>Daily Mail</b> the maths-phobic were entreated not to worry since ‘Simon Singh spares us most of the maths, and he juggles big ideas with tact and care’. For anyone who struggles to understand science, suggested the reviewers, <i>Big Bang</i> was a good place to begin: ‘Even if the cosmologists don’t know where the universe is going, at least they have found out where it has come from. Anybody who wants to understand this wonderful achievement will not do better than start with Singh’s book,’ declared the <b>Mail on Sunday. •</b></p>
<h2 class="left">The Missing Pages</h2>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Simon Singh<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">At roughly 550 pages, <i>Big Bang</i> is substantially longer than originally planned. In fact my original book proposal was entitled <i>The Little Book of the Big Bang</i> and the entire story of the greatest scientific theory in history was supposed to have been encapsulated in a couple of hundred pages. I soon realised that it was impossible to do justice to the Big Bang without running to several hundred pages, and before long there was a serious risk of breaking the 1,000-page barrier. My main problem was that I felt compelled to pass on everything I found during my research, from mind-boggling scientific notions to yet another forgotten hero of cosmology.</p>

<p class="noindent">‘I soon realised that it was impossible to do justice to the Big Bang without running to several hundred pages.’</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Hence, after completing my first draft of <i>Big Bang,</i> I embarked on the painful process of cutting back the content to make the book less intimidating and more accessible, less meandering and more engaging. Of course some sections were harder to cull than others, simply because I had become particularly fond of them.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, <i>Big Bang</i> used to contain the tale of the Heike crab, a species that is famous because its shell often looks like a samurai mask. The traditional explanation is that the crabs contain the souls of samurai soldiers belonging to the Heike clan, who drowned in a sea battle in 1185. For this reason, today’s fishermen always throw back to the sea any crabs exhibiting the distinctive samurai shell, as it would be unthinkable to eat a creature with the soul of a samurai. In fact a tiny fraction of these crabs have always exhibited a vaguely samurai appearance, but their numbers increased dramatically and their samurai appearance was enhanced after the battle of 1185 when fishermen started to take more notice of them and the practice of not eating such crabs began. Suddenly there was a huge survival advantage for a crab to look like a samurai, so this property was exaggerated and promulgated to create the large population of samurai-looking crabs that we have today.</p>
<p class="indent">I have wanted to retell this piece of evolutionary biology ever since reading about it in Carl Sagan’s <i>Cosmos,</i> so I included it in my first draft of Chapter 1. I still think it is a fascinating story, but in the context of the Big Bang it was a self-indulgent detour. I will not explain how I originally managed to fit the Heike crab into Chapter 1, but I will admit that it required clumsy crowbarring of the worst kind.</p>

<p class="noindent">‘Some sections were harder to cull than others, simply because I had become particularly fond of them.’</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Similarly, the first incarnation of Chapter 2 had a section about the Jesuit priest Giovanni Riccioli who published the <i>New Almagest</i> in 1651, which included meticulous drawings of the lunar surface and labelled features such as the lowland plains. He labelled each so-called sea according to a state of mind, such as the Sea of Tranquillity or the Sea of Madness, and this rule for naming lunar plains has remained ever since. In 1959, however, a Soviet probe sent back images of the previously unseen far side of the Moon and the Russians broke Riccioli’s protocol by calling one region the Sea of Moscow. The International Astronomical Union rejected the name, until Soviet astronomers convinced the IAU that there was such a thing as a ‘Moscow state of mind’. I still think this is a wonderfully quirky story, but reluctantly I had to discard it, because Riccioli and his lunar seas were not directly relevant to the real story that I ought to have been telling in Chapter 2.</p>
<p class="indent">Exactly the same problem has arisen with my previous books – several quirky asides had to be lost because they were not directly relevant to the history of Fermat’s Last Theorem or the development of cryptography. Perhaps my favourite lost episode concerns a magic square that appeared in an early draft of <i>The Code Book.</i><br/><br/></p>
<p class="center">S     A     T     O     R</p>
<p class="center">A     R     E     P     O</p>
<p class="center">T     E     N     E     T</p>
<p class="center">O     P     E     R     A</p>
<p class="center">R     O     T     A     S<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">This square carries the Latin motto <i>sator arepo tenet opera rotas,</i> which means something along the lines of ‘Arepo the sower holds the wheels at work.’ It is a magic square because the same message can be read from left to right, right to left, up the columns and down the columns. However, the letters only gain their true meaning when they are anagrammed into a new arrangement.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="center">P</p>
<p class="center">A</p>
<p class="center">A     T     O</p>
<p class="center">E</p>
<p class="center">R</p>
<p class="center">P     A     T     E     R     N     O     S     T     E     R</p>
<p class="center">O</p>
<p class="center">S</p>
<p class="center">O     T     A</p>
<p class="center">E</p>
<p class="center">R<br/><br/></p>
<p class="noindent">The word <i>paternoster</i> (Our Father) can be created twice. This is only possible if the <i>N</i> is shared, so the letters are formed into a cross. Moreover, the only letters not required to construct <i>paternoster</i> twice are a pair of As and Os, which symbolise alphas and omegas, beginnings and ends. In other words, the magic square is clever as it stands, but it also has hidden cleverness because encoded within it are three elements <i>(paternoster,</i> the cross, alpha/omega) of deep significance to Christians. Historians are divided as to the origins and true significance of this magic square, but it seems to be a beautiful illustration of a steganography, which means hiding an important message within an apparently innocuous text or image. This cryptographic oddity has been lying in my files ever since it was cut from <i>The Code Book.</i></p>
<p class="indent">It seems a shame to have cut the magic square from <i>The Code Book,</i> just as it was disappointing to have omitted the tales of the Heike crab and the Sea of Madness from <i>Big Bang,</i> but ultimately I have to remember that my books are not random collections of vaguely related episodes, but rather they are supposed to be coherent histories of science. I am just grateful that this postscript essay has at least allowed me the opportunity to get these three curiosities out of my system.</p>
