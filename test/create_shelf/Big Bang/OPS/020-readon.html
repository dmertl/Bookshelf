<h3 class="left">Fermat’s Last Theorem</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">In 1963 a schoolboy browsing in his local library stumbled across the world’s greatest mathematical problem: Fermat’s Last Theorem, a puzzle that has baffled mathematicians for over 300 years. Aged just ten, Andrew Wiles dreamed that he would crack it. Wiles’s lifelong obsession with a seemingly simple challenge set by a long-dead Frenchman is an emotional tale of sacrifice and extraordinary determination. In the end Wiles was forced to work in secrecy and isolation for seven years, harnessing all the power of modern maths to achieve his childhood dream. Many before him had tried and failed, including an eighteenth-century philanderer who was killed in a duel. At roughly the same time a Frenchwoman made a major breakthrough in solving the riddle, but she had to attend maths lectures at the Ecole Polytechnique disguised as a man since women were forbidden entry to the school. A remarkable story of human endeavour and intellectual brilliance over three centuries, <i>Fermat’s Last Theorem</i> will fascinate both specialist and general readers.</p>
<h3 class="left">The Code Book</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Since humans began writing, they have been writing in code. This quest for secrecy has often changed the course of history. In <i>The Code Book,</i> Simon Singh offers a sweeping view of the subject of encryption as well as its more dramatic effects on the outcome of wars, monarchies and individual lives.</p>
<p class="noindent">Included in this fascinating book is the story of Mary Queen of Scots, trapped by her own code and put to death by Queen Elizabeth. Also recounted is the history of the Beale Ciphers, created in the early nineteenth century to obscure the location of a treasure of gold, buried somewhere in Virginia. Singh also traces the monumental improvements in code-making and -breaking brought on by the First and Second World Wars, including the development of the German Enigma cipher machine, which was cracked by the brilliant Allied code-breakers at Bletchley Park. Now, in the Information Age, the possibility of a truly unbreakable code looms large, and information security has become one of the major debates of our times. Simon Singh investigates how technology and the ways we communicate will affect our personal privacy and our everyday lives. Dramatic, compelling and remarkably far-reaching, this book will forever alter your view of history, what drives it, and how private that e-mail you just sent really is.</p>
<h3 class="left">The Cracking Code Book</h3>
<p class="noindent" style="margin-top:1em;">Simon Singh brings life to an amazing story of puzzles, codes, lost languages and riddles in this abridged and adapted version of <i>The Code Book</i> aimed at younger readers. Children and teenagers will be drawn into the history of codes and code-breaking from Ancient Egypt to the internet. This history of cryptography involves tales of heroism and villainy, and at the same time it explains the science and mathematics behind the world’s cleverest codes.</p>
